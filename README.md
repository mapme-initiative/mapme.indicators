# mapme.indicators

## Introduction

This package is work-in-progress. The aim is to support biodiversity related
indicators from the publication of [Voskamp et al. (2023)](https://www.cell.com/one-earth/fulltext/S2590-3322(23)00387-1)
to support enhanced targeting of conservation efforts.
At the same time it serves as an technical example how the core MAPME package
can be extended by third-parties.


## Installation

Currently, this package is compatible with the dev version of `{mapme.biodiversity}` only.
Please run the following code to install the packages:

```        
remotes::install_github("mapme-initiative/mapme.biodiversity", ref = "virtualize-tileindex")
remotes::install_github("mapme-initiative/mapme.indicators")
```

## Usage

The package adds a number of indicators used by the Legacy Landscape Fund to analyse protected areas. It is ready-to-use in a workflow based on\
`{mapme.biodiversity}`.

Once the package is loaded in your R session via `library(mapme.indicators)`, the new resources and associated indicators are registered and available for your workflows.
