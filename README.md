# mapme.indicators

## Introduction

This package is currently work-in-progress. It is going to be used to develop new resources/indicators while `{mapme.biodiversity}` is undergoing a number of functionality changes. To learn more about the ongoing changes and their current status, please visit the [announcement issue](https://github.com/mapme-initiative/mapme.biodiversity/issues/240).

The branch you are seeing here links against `{mapme.biodiversity}` v0.8.0.

We will update the resource/indicator functions developed here once a new version is released.

After reaching all milestones in `{mapme.biodiversity}`, we will decide whether to move the resources/indicators developed here into the main package or if the resources/indicators will be moved here.

## Installation

Please run the following code to install the required packages:

```         
remotes::install_version("mapme.biodiversity", version = "0.7.0")
remotes::install_github("mapme-initiative/mapme.indicators")
```

## Resources and Indicators

The package adds new resources and indicators. It is ready-to-use in a workflow based onÂ `{mapme.biodiversity}`.

Once the package is loaded in your R session via `library(mapme.indicators)`, the new resources and associated indicators are registered and available for your workflows.

The table below gives an overview of implemented and planned resources/indicators:
