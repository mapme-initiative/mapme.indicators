\description{
This resource is part of the publication by Noon et al. (2022) "Mapping the
irrecoverable carbon in Earth’s ecosystems". This publication differentiates
between 3 different kinds of carbon with varying degrees of manageability
by humans. All three layers are available for above and below ground
carbon, as well as a layer combining the two.

\details{
Irrecoverable carbon is defined as the amount of carbon, that, if lost today,
cannot be recovered until mid 21st century (so within 30 years, considering
the publication date).

Vulnerable carbon is defined as the amount of carbon that would be lost in a
hypothetical but typical conversion event (without including information
of the probability of such an event to be actually occurring).

Manageable carbon is defined as all land areas, expect cyrosols, because
carbon loss is driven by direct land-use conversion which could be halted or
because climate change impacts affecting the area can potentially be directly
mitigated through adaptive management.
