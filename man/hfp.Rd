\title{Calculate human footprint statistics}
\usage{
calc_hfp(engine = "extract", stats = "mean")
}
\arguments{
\item{engine}{The preferred processing functions from either one of "zonal",
"extract" or "exactextract" as character.}

\item{stats}{Function to be applied to compute statistics for polygons either
one or multiple inputs as character. Supported statistics are: "mean",
"median", "sd", "min", "max", "sum" "var".}
}
\value{
A function that returns a tibble with a column for each statistic
and a row for every requested year.
}
\description{
Human footprint data measures the pressure imposed on the natural environment
by different dimensions of human actions. The theoretical maximum value,
representing the highest level of human pressure, is 50. This routine allows
to extract zonal statistics of the human footprint data.
