\description{
This resource is part of the publication by Noon et al. (2022) "Mapping the
irrecoverable carbon in Earth’s ecosystems". This publication differentiates
between 3 different kinds of carbon with varying degrees of manageability
by humans. All three layers are available for above and below ground
carbon, as well as a layer combining the two.
}
\details{
Manageable carbon is defined as all land areas, expect cyrosols, because
carbon loss is driven by direct land-use conversion which could be halted or
because climate change impacts affecting the area can potentially be directly
mitigated through adaptive management.
